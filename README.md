# Epigraph

Epigraph is an application to **browse, search, and read highlights and notes** exported from **KOReader**.

It takes KOReader export files and presents their contents in a clean, readable, and structured way, making it easy to revisit highlights, annotations, and bookmarks outside the e-reader.

## Purpose

- View highlights and notes in a comfortable reading interface
- Navigate content by book and chapter
- Keep a long-term, searchable archive of reading notes

Epigraph is designed to be simple, fast, and focused on reading, not editing.
